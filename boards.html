    <h3>Data Visualization Utilizing Data Science</h3>
    <p>In this course, you will learn to create data visualization graphs for small and Big Data. You will take data you
        have mined, or from a source
        which has mined it. You will then structure the data to provide a foundation to be used with data visualization
        tools. Once the data is
        structured in a meaningful way, it can be coupled with different data visualization tools. Using these tools,
        you will learn how to identify data
        trends and patters which can answer questions you were not able to before.
